<a id="question1"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a> 
<h3> My pet has been missing for a month. Can a search dog still pick up a scent and help me find my lost pet? </h3>
<p> Yes, a well trained dog will find your pet. </p>

<a id="question2"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a>
<h3> What is your success rate? </h3>
<p> This is not a simple question to answer because success can have several definitions. In general, people who contact us end up getting their pets back at least 70% of the time. This is not necessarily due to our assistance; some cats and dogs just come home on their own, or they may have gotten a call from the local shelter, for example. We do know, based on records of over a thousand cases, that following our methods increases your odds of successfully finding your pet. </p>

<a id="question3"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a>
<h3>My neighbors say that my cat (or small dog) has probably been killed by a coyote. Is this true?</h3>
<p> It is very unlikely that your pet has been killed by a coyote. Of all the possible reasons that your pet is missing, predation by a coyote is one of the least likely. It does happen, but it is much less common than people think. In fact, the myth that most missing pets were taken by coyotes is responsible for more missing pets than the coyotes themselves: people believe there is no hope, they stop looking, and their pets are not found in a timely manner. Of the 676 pets we helped in 2011, only 13 were proven to have been taken by a predator. Over 450 of those pets were found, one way or another. In nearly 100% of the cases where we have provided assistance, someone has told the owner of the missing pet that their cat or small dog was taken by a coyote. We know that is not true at least 90% of the time, possibly 98% of the time. We don’t currently know why the myth of coyotes killing pets is so widespread, but it doesn’t help people get their pets back. If your cat or small dog is missing, be prepared that someone will tell you it was killed by a coyote, and also know that what they say is probably not true. </p>

<a id="question4"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a>
<h3> Why shouldn’t I call my dog’s name when I’m looking for him? </h3>
<p> Usually, before people contact us for help, they go out calling the name of their missing dog. In rare instances, this can work. However, most of the time, it does more harm than good. If a dog is not coming home on his own, it is probably because he has had some sort of frightening encounter. When a dog enters the “flight mode” state of mind, he will either remain hidden or run away when anyone or anything focuses attention on him. Even if it is his favorite human, who he has known for years, intense focus on the dog will heighten his anxiety and force him to run. We have witnessed many occasions where a missing dog was located by the owners. At that moment, the dog stood prepared to run away. By using calming signals, owners can reduce the anxiety of the “flight mode” dog and help him overcome his fears. Our Lost Pet Consultants can coach you on the alternatives to calling your dog’s name. </p>

<h3>  How likely is it that I will ever see my dog or cat again? </h3>
<p>You have at least a 70% chance of recovering your pet, possibly higher. If you made no effort at all to find your pet, he still might be returned to you via a microchip, a collar tag, or a helpful neighbor who recognized him. Millions of pets go missing every year, and at least half of them are found one way or another, according to some studies. According to the records we keep, at least 70% of the people who contacted us for help eventually found their pets. The actual number may be higher, but not everyone responds to our follow up inquiries. When someone has lost a pet, he or she is likely unaware of all the different methods available to find a lost pet. Our goal, as an organization, is to increase the chances of successful recovery by helping the owners of lost pets to investigate every avenue by which their lost pet may be recovered. Perhaps more importantly, we can explain which actions actually reduce your chances of recovering your pet, and help you avoid them. We know that one of leading reasons that people don’t find their pets is because they think it is hopeless and they stop looking. Almost all owners of missing pets have reached a point where they thought it was hopeless and there was no point in looking. Those who have persisted are most often rewarded for their efforts. </p>

<h3> I am going out to look for my dog or cat. Can you tell me where to look first, to make best use of my time? </h3>
<p> Contact local animal shelters and animal control agencies. Search the neighborhood.  Advertise. Try the internet, there are many sites that may be able to help.  Be wary of pet-recovery scams.  Dont give up your search.  </p>

<a id="question7"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a>
<h3>Can you recommend someone in my area?  </h3>
<p> Our National Directory lists individuals who have taken our Missing Animal Response (MAR) training. We are not a governing body, and we don’t oversee the actions and methods of those who have received our training. A few people have been removed from our directory after we investigated complaints about them and found those complaints to have merit. As far as we know, the individuals in our directory are competent and caring professionals. However, in most cases, we don’t have much experience working with them and we can’t recommend one individual over another. It would be up to you to evaluate the suitability of anyone listed in our directory. We strongly recommend requesting references from past clients before hiring any pet detective. </p>

<a id="question8"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a>
<h3>  Are there pet detectives or lost pet searchers that I should avoid? </h3>
<p> We have received complaints about certain individuals (none of which is currently listed in our directory), but we don’t have the resources to investigate all claims of fraud or incompetence. There certainly are individuals you should avoid, but we don’t have the authority to tell you not to use them. Also, as a non-profit, we cannot afford to be sued by someone who disagrees with our assessment. There are also scammers out there who collect a fee and never have any intention of doing a search for your pet. Before hiring anyone to help you find your lost pet, you should have a clear understanding of what they can and cannot do. You should also ask for references from past clients. </p>

<a id="question9"> <!--empty anchor destination --> </a>
<h3> Why do you think my pet is lost? </h3>
<p> There are many reasons: Boredom and lonliness.  They are in an unfamiliar home or new location. They react to a frightening sound or situation. There is access to an easy escape.   </p>
