<h1>Whom to Contact</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center"> Below are the various entities that deal with lost and found pets. 
Please contact them, they are a great resource. </h3> </br>

<div id="authorities">
<h3> Police and Animal Control </h3>
<p>These are government agencies, usually municipal or county, that are responsible for dealing with lost and found pets, among other animal related issues.

Municipalities often have an animal control department. Except for large cities, they usually do not have a shelter, but they may have a temporary holding area. In small communities there may not be a dedicated animal control person. In that case the police may be able to help.

Use a search engine, like Google, or dial 411, to get phone numbers for police and animal control in your community.

<div id="shelters">
<h3> Pounds and Shelters </h3>
<p>Most urban municipalities maintain a pound or a shelter. Many states, like Ohio, have a shelter for each county. As government agencies, these shelters are open admission which means they take in all animals that they pick up or are surrendered. The holding period for animals that have been picked up or surrendered is usually governed by law. It varies from state to state but averages about four days. It is imperative to visit in person any shelters where your pet might turn up as soon and as often as possible. Just contacting shelters or paying a service to contact them is usually ineffective.

<div id="humaneSocieties">
<h3> Humane Societies </h3>
<p>
These are generally private entities and usually non-profit. They depend on public support to pay the bills. Some humane societies have a policy of never euthanizing animals for want of space. They must limit how many animals they can take in. Other humane societies have open admission, which means that they will take in all pets that are surrendered but they may be put down if they are not adopted.
</p>
</div>
<div id="rescueGroups">
<h3> Rescue Groups </h3>
<p>
Rescues are usually small organizations, sometimes only a single individual. Some specialize in a certain type of animal, like ferrets or birds, or in a certain breed of dog or cat.

They often save companion animals from situations of abuse, neglect or abandonment. Some rescue groups pull dogs or cats from shelters and foster them until they can be placed. Rescue groups do not usually have a shelter. Instead they foster the animals in their homes.

A lost pet may turn up with a rescue group after being found as a stray, or rescued from a bad situation, or after spending time in a shelter. Especially if your lost pet is a special breed, it would be a good idea to contact the appropriate rescue group.
